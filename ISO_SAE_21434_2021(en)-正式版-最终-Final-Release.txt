Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization) is a worldwide federation of national standards
bodies (ISO member bodies). The work of preparing International Standards is normally carried out
through ISO technical committees. Each member body interested in a subject for which a technical
committee has been established has the right to be represented on that committee. International
organizations, governmental and non-governmental, in liaison with ISO, also take part in the work.
ISO collaborates closely with the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) on all matters of
electrotechnical standardization.

SAE International is a global association of more than 128,000 engineers and related technical experts
in the aerospace, automotive and commercial-vehicle industries. Standards from SAE International
are used to advance mobility engineering throughout the world. The SAE Technical Standards
Development Program is among the organization's primary provisions to those mobility industries
it serves aerospace, automotive, and commercial vehicle. These works are authorized, revised, and
maintained by the volunteer efforts of more than 9,000 engineers, and other qualified professionals
from around the world. SAE subject matter experts act as individuals in the standards process, not
as representatives of their organizations. Thus, SAE standards represent optimal technical content
developed in a transparent, open, and collaborative process.
The procedures used to develop this document and those intended for its further maintenance are

An item comprises all electronic equipment and software (i.e. its components) in a vehicle involved in
the realization of a specific functionality at vehicle level, e.g. braking. An item or a component interacts
with its operational environment.

to the vehicle (e.g. back-end servers) can be considered for cybersecurity purposes but are not in the
scope of this document.

This document describes cybersecurity engineering from the perspective of a single item. The suitable
allocation of functionality to items within the E/E architecture of a road vehicle is not specified in
this document. For the vehicle as a whole, the vehicle E/E architecture or the set of the cybersecurity
cases of its cybersecurity-relevant items and components can be considered. If cybersecurity activities
described in this document are performed on items and components, then unreasonable vehicle
cybersecurity risk is addressed.
The overall cybersecurity risk management of an organization described in this document applies
throughout all lifecycle phases as illustrated in Figure 2.

Figure 2 — Overall cybersecurity risk management
Cybersecurity risk management is applied throughout the supply chain to support cybersecurity
engineering. Automotive supply chains exhibit diverse models of collaboration. Not all cybersecurity
activities apply to all organizations involved in a specific project. Cybersecurity activities can be
tailored to accommodate the needs of a specific situation (see Clause 6). Development partners for a
specific item or component agree on the work-split so that the applicable cybersecurity activities are
performed (see Clause 7).
Figure 3 shows the relationship between an item, function, component and related terms.

﻿

Figure 3 — Relationship between item, function, component and related terms
Clause 15 describes modular methods for assessment of cybersecurity risk that are invoked in
cybersecurity activities described in other clauses.

Analysis activities in the context of cybersecurity engineering identify and explore potential actions
performed by abstract adversarial actors with malicious intent and the damage that can arise from
the compromise of cybersecurity of the vehicle E/E systems. Coordination between cybersecurity
engineering and expertise from other disciplines can support the in-depth analysis and mitigation of
specific cybersecurity risks (cf. ISO/TR 4804 [6]). Cybersecurity monitoring, remediation and incident
response activities complement concept and product development activities as a reactive approach
acknowledging the changing conditions in the environment (e.g. new attack technologies) and the
ongoing need to identify and manage weaknesses and vulnerabilities in road vehicle E/E systems.

A defence-in-depth approach can be used to mitigate cybersecurity risk. The defence-in-depth approach
utilizes layers of cybersecurity controls to improve the cybersecurity of the vehicle. If an attack is able
to penetrate or bypass one layer, another layer can help contain the attack and maintain protection of
the assets.

5 Organizational cybersecurity management

6 Project dependent cybersecurity management
6.1 General

This clause describes the requirements regarding the management of cybersecurity development
activities for a specific project.

Project dependent cybersecurity management includes the allocation of responsibilities (see 6.4.1) and
planning of the cybersecurity activities (see 6.4.2). This document defines requirements in a generic
manner such that it can be applied to a variety of items and components. In addition, tailoring can be
applied (see 6.4.3) that is based on a rationale and is defined in the cybersecurity plan. Examples of
when tailoring can be used include:
— reuse (see 6.4.4),

— component out-of-context (see 6.4.5),

— use of an off-the-shelf component (see 6.4.6),
— update (see 13.4).

Reuse of items and components is a possible development strategy that can be applied, with or without
modifications to an item, component, or their operational environment. However, modifications can
introduce vulnerabilities that might not have been considered for the original item or component.
Furthermore, there might have been a change in known attacks, for example:
— an evolution of attack techniques,

— newly emerged vulnerabilities, e.g. learned from cybersecurity monitoring (see 8.3) and/or
cybersecurity event evaluation (see 8.4), or
— a change of the assets since the original development.

If the original item or component was developed in accordance with this document, the reuse of that
item or component is based on the existing work products. If the item or component was not originally
developed in accordance with this document, the reuse can be based on the existing documentation
with a rationale.

﻿

A component can be developed out-of-context, i.e. based on an assumed context. An organization can
develop generic components for different applications and for different customers, prior to engagement
or commercial agreement with a customer. The supplier can make assumptions about the context and
intended use. Based on this, the supplier can derive requirements for the out-of-context development.
For example, a microcontroller can be developed out-of-context.
An off-the-shelf component is a component that is not developed on behalf of a specific customer and
that can be used without modification of its design or implementation, e.g. a third-party software
library, an open source software component. An off-the-shelf component is not assumed to have been
developed in accordance with this document.

Figure 5 shows that both an off-the-shelf component and an out-of-context component can be integrated
into an item or component in accordance with this document. The integration can involve activities
similar to reuse analysis in 6.4.4, and if changes are made to address invalid assumptions then change
management (see 5.4.4) applies. The changes can be made to a component that is intended to be
integrated and/or to the component or item that is the target of the integration.

Figure 5 — Integration of off-the-shelf and out-of-context components
The cybersecurity case (see 6.4.7) is an input to a cybersecurity assessment and to the release for postdevelopment.

The cybersecurity assessment (see 6.4.8) judges independently the cybersecurity of an item or
component and is an input for the decision to the release for post-development (see 6.4.9).

6.2 Objectives

The objectives of this clause are to:
a)

assign the responsibilities regarding the project’s cybersecurity activities;

c)

create a cybersecurity case;

e)

decide whether the item or component can be released for post-development from a cybersecurity
perspective.

b) plan the cybersecurity activities, including the definition of the tailored cybersecurity activities;
d) perform a cybersecurity assessment, if applicable; and

information for triage based on defined triggers.

Cybersecurity event evaluation (see 8.4) determines if the cybersecurity event presents a weakness for
an item or component.
Vulnerability analysis (see 8.5) examines weaknesses and assesses if a particular weakness can be
exploited.

Vulnerability management (see 8.6) tracks and oversees the treatment of identified vulnerabilities in
items and components until their end of cybersecurity support.

8.2 Objectives

The objectives of this clause are to:
a)

9 Concept

Evidence of managed vulnerabilities, resulting from [RQ-08-07]

9.1 General
The concept phase involves consideration of vehicle level functionality, as implemented in items. In this
clause, the item and its operational environment are identified as an “Item definition” (see 9.3). The
item definition forms the basis for the subsequent activities.

This clause also specifies cybersecurity goals for the item (see 9.4), which are the highest level of
requirements. For this purpose, cybersecurity risks are assessed, which is achieved by using the
methods of Clause 15 (see also Annex H, Figure H.1). In addition, 9.4 specifies cybersecurity claims,
which are used to explain why risk retention or sharing are considered adequate.
The cybersecurity concept (see 9.5) consists of cybersecurity requirements and requirements on
the operational environment, both of which are derived from the cybersecurity goals and based on a
comprehensive view of the item.

9.2 Objectives

The objectives of this clause are to:
a)

define the item, its operational environment and their interactions in the context of cybersecurity;

c)

specify the cybersecurity concept to achieve cybersecurity goals.

b) specify cybersecurity goals and cybersecurity claims; and

10 Product development
10.1 General

This clause describes the specification of the cybersecurity requirements and architectural design (see
10.4.1).
Additionally, this clause describes integration and verification activities (see 10.4.2).

These cybersecurity activities are performed iteratively until no further refinements of cybersecurity
controls are needed. The cybersecurity specifications are defined and confirmed through verification
activities for the fulfilment of the cybersecurity concept.
Figure 9 illustrates an example of how product development activities can be applied to a V-model-based
workflow, where 10.4.1 corresponds to the left side of the V-model and 10.4.2 corresponds to the right
side. In this example, two layers of abstraction are assumed under the item level, namely component
level and sub-component level. This workflow can be extended to cover any level of abstraction.

14 End of cybersecurity support and decommissioning
14.1 General
Decommissioning is different from end of cybersecurity support. An organization can end cybersecurity
support for an item or component, but that item or component can still function as designed in the field.
Both decommissioning and end of cybersecurity support can present cybersecurity implications, but
those implications are considered separately.
Decommissioning can occur without the organization’s knowledge and in such a way that
decommissioning procedures cannot be enforced, therefore the act of decommissioning is out of scope
of this document.
End of cybersecurity support and decommissioning are considered in the concept and product
development phases.

14.2 Objectives

The objectives of this clause are to:
a)

communicate the end of cybersecurity support; and

b) enable decommissioning of items and components with regard to cybersecurity.

15 Threat analysis and risk assessment methods
15.1 General
This clause describes methods to determine the extent to which a road user can be impacted by a threat
scenario. These methods and their work products are collectively known as a threat analysis and risk
assessment (TARA) and are performed from the viewpoint of affected road users. The methods defined
in this clause are generic modules that can be invoked systematically, and from any point in the lifecycle
of an item or component:
— asset identification (see 15.3);

— threat scenario identification (see 15.4);
— impact rating (see 15.5);

— attack path analysis (see 15.6);

— attack feasibility rating (see 15.7);

— risk value determination (see 15.8); and
— risk treatment decision (see 15.9).

Because these are generic modules, the work products defined in this clause are documented as parts
of work products produced by other clauses.
See Annex H for an illustration of these methods with a practical example.

Organization specific scales for impact rating, attack feasibility rating and risk value determination can
be applied and mapped to the corresponding scales defined in this document.

15.2 Objectives

The objectives of this clause are to:
a)

identify assets, their cybersecurity properties and their damage scenarios;

c)

determine the impact rating of damage scenarios;

e)

determine the ease with which attack paths can be exploited;

b) identify threat scenarios;

d) identify the attack paths that realize threat scenarios;
f)

determine the risk values of threat scenarios; and

g) select appropriate risk treatment options for threat scenarios.

[RC-15-11] The attack feasibility rating method should be defined based on one of the following
approaches:
a)

attack potential-based approach;

c)

attack vector-based approach.

b) CVSS-based approach; or
NOTE 1

Selection of the approach can depend upon the phase in the lifecycle and available information.

[RC-15-12] If an attack potential-based approach is used, the attack feasibility rating should be
determined based on core factors including:
a)

elapsed time;

c)

knowledge of the item or component;

e)

equipment.

b) specialist expertise;

d) window of opportunity; and
NOTE 2
NOTE 3

The core attack potential factors can be derived from ISO/IEC 18045 [23].

G.2 provides guidelines on determining attack feasibility based on attack potential.

[RC-15-13] If a CVSS-based approach is used, the attack feasibility rating should be determined based
on the exploitability metrics of the base metric group, including:
a)

attack vector;

c)

privileges required; and

b) attack complexity;
d) user interaction.
NOTE 4

G.3 provides guidelines on determining attack feasibility based on a CVSS-based approach.

NOTE 5

G.4 provides guidelines on determining attack feasibility based on an attack vector-based approach.

[RC-15-14] If an attack vector-based approach is used, the attack feasibility rating should be
determined based on evaluating the predominant attack vector (cf. CVSS [24] 2.1.1) of the attack path.
NOTE 6
During the early stages of development (e.g. concept phase), when there is insufficient information to
identify specific attack paths, an attack vector-based approach can be suitable to estimate attack feasibility.

associated damage scenarios and the attack feasibility of the associated attack paths.

NOTE 1
If a threat scenario corresponds to more than one damage scenario and/or an associated damage
scenario has impacts in more than one impact category, a separate risk value can be determined separately for
each of those impact ratings.
NOTE 2
If the threat scenario corresponds to more than one attack path, the associated attack feasibility
ratings can be appropriately aggregated, e.g. the threat scenario is assigned the maximum of the attack feasibility
ratings of the corresponding attack paths.

[RQ-15-16] The risk value of a threat scenario shall be a value between (and including) 1 and 5, where
a value of 1 represents minimal risk.

Annex E
(informative)

Cybersecurity assurance levels

E.1 General
This annex describes a cybersecurity assurance level (CAL) classification scheme that can be used
to specify and communicate a set of assurance requirements, in terms of levels of rigour to provide
confidence that protection of the assets of an item or component is adequately developed. This CAL
classification scheme does not specify technical requirements for cybersecurity controls, however it
can be used to drive the cybersecurity engineering, providing a common language for communicating
cybersecurity assurance requirements among the organizations involved.
A CAL can be determined by the organization developing an item or assumed by an organization
developing a component out of context.

Once determined, a CAL specifies the amount of rigour required in the subsequent product development
activities to address threat scenarios requiring reducing the risk. This can be achieved by assigning the
CAL as an attribute of a cybersecurity goal, which is inherited by refined cybersecurity requirements.

E.2 Determining a CAL

A CAL is indirectly related to risk; however, it cannot be directly determined from a risk value. This is
because the risk value is dynamic, varying over time depending on the evolving specification, design,
implementation and operational environment of the item or component, whereas the CAL expresses a
level of assurance that is to remain fixed over time. Therefore, a CAL can be determined at the start of
development during the concept phase using parameters that are expected to remain stable until end
of cybersecurity support, for example parameters based on the assets of an item and aspects of their
associated risks, before consideration of the implementation of cybersecurity controls. The relationship
between a CAL and associated risk is illustrated in Figure E.1.

Event 1: cybersecurity requirement is specified.
Event 2: cybersecurity control is implemented.
Event 3: test shows cybersecurity control is effective.
Event 4: vulnerability is discovered in the field.
Event 5: vulnerability is fixed.
CAL is determined and assigned.
CAL is applied in cybersecurity activities.

Risk value is dynamic and can vary depending on current specification, design or implementation.
The expected level of assurance determined at E1 given the criticality of the assets to be protected prescribes
the rigour of subsequent cybersecurity activities at E2, E3.

Figure E.1 — Relationship between a CAL and risk

A CAL can be determined based on consideration of the identified threat scenarios (see 15.4). Table E.1
gives an example based on four CALs, each corresponding to an increasing level of assurance based
on the cybersecurity engineering methods used. The example shows CALs assigned based on the
maximum impact and the attack vector of the relevant threat scenarios.

Sharing a documented rationale for the determination of a CAL between customer and supplier can
improve mutual understanding. A CAL classification scheme and determined CALs can also be part of
the cybersecurity interface agreement between customer and supplier.

A single CAL can be assigned to all cybersecurity goals of an item or different CALs can be assigned
to each cybersecurity goal. If cybersecurity goals are combined, the highest of the individual CALs is
assigned to the combined cybersecurity goal.

E.3 Using a CAL
E.3.1 General considerations
A CAL classification scheme can be used to determine the level of rigour with which cybersecurity
activities are performed, in terms of the effort necessary to provide the required assurance.
A CAL can be used to select:
a)

methods used for development and verification;

c)

approaches for cybersecurity assessment.

b) methods to identify weaknesses and analyse vulnerabilities; and
Table E.2 provides an example of a number of CALs and guidance for their usage during the concept
and the product development phases. For each increase in CAL, the corresponding methods represent
a meaningful increase in the assurance of the item or component by the design, verification, and
cybersecurity assessment. Examples in Tables E.2, E.3 and E.4 are provided to enable industry
experience to be gained in using CALs to scale the activities described in this document.

This subclause provides an example on the usage of a CAL classification scheme to adapt the rigour and
extent of development measures.

In the concept phase, with the definition of the cybersecurity concept and the allocation of cybersecurity
requirements to components of the preliminary architecture, CALs can be used as follows as an
extension to [RQ-09-10]:
a)

cybersecurity requirements derived from a cybersecurity goal inherit the CAL from that
cybersecurity goal;

b) if multiple cybersecurity requirements with different CALs inherited from multiple cybersecurity
goals are allocated to an architectural component, the highest CAL is assigned to the component;

c)

ISO/SAE 21434:2021(E)
﻿

if the component is confirmed as protected from the other components in the architecture, the CAL
assigned to the component can be reduced or rendered unnecessary, based on a rationale.

E.3.3 Product development

An application of a CAL classification scheme in product development can be to use CAL-dependent
methods and measures.

In product development, if cybersecurity requirements are allocated to components, and isolation from
other components cannot be confirmed, then the components can be developed in accordance with the
highest CAL for those cybersecurity requirements.

Tables E.3 and E.4 provide examples of how CAL can be applied to a sample of cybersecurity activities;
further cybersecurity activities can be addressed in a similar way.
Table E.3 provides an example of how CAL can be used to determine the level of independence with
which the respective activities are performed.

Guidelines for impact rating

F.1 General
This annex gives examples of criteria for impact rating (see 15.5) for damage scenarios involving safety,
financial, operational and privacy damage. The tables (see Table F.1 through Table F.4) in this annex can
be used for impact rating.

Considerations on how the scalability of damage (i.e. impact to multiple road users in a single damage
scenario) modify the impact rating have not been included in the examples given, but can be added to
the organization‑specific rating criteria as appropriate (e.g. Reference [20], C.1.2, Table 4).

Annex G
(informative)

Guidelines for attack feasibility rating

G.1 General
This annex provides guidelines on how the following approaches can be applied for attack feasibility
rating (see 15.7):
— attack potential-based;
— CVSS-based; and

— attack vector-based.

Considerations whether an attack has the potential to scale (i.e. be easily extended to multiple instances
and targets) can be included in the rating of attack feasibility.

G.2 Guidelines for the attack potential-based approach
G.2.1 Background on attack potential

Attack potential is defined in ISO/IEC 18045 [23] as a measure of the effort to be expended in attacking
an item or component, expressed in terms of an attacker's expertise and resources. Attack potential
relies on five core parameters:
— elapsed time;

— specialist expertise;

— knowledge of the item or component;
— window of opportunity; and
— equipment.

This subclause gives examples of customization and example mappings to attack feasibility.

G.2.2 Example of adaptation of the parameters
G.2.2.1

Example customization of elapsed time

The elapsed time parameter includes the time to identify a vulnerability and develop and (successfully)
apply an exploit. Therefore, this rating is based on the state of expert knowledge at the time of rating,
see Table G.1.

Example customization of specialist expertise

The expertise parameter is related to the capabilities of the attacker, relative to their skill and
experience, see Table G.2.
Table G.2 — Specialist expertise

Layman:
Unknowledgeable compared to experts or proficient persons, with no particular expertise.

EXAMPLE 1 Ordinary person using step-by-step descriptions of an attack that is publicly
available.
Proficient:

Knowledgeable in that they are familiar with the security behaviour of the product or system
type.
EXAMPLE 2 Experienced owner, ordinary technician knowing simple and popular attacks
like odometer tuning, installation of counterfeit parts.
Expert:

Familiar with the underlying algorithms, protocols, hardware, structures, security behaviour,
principles and concepts of security employed, techniques and tools for the definition of new
attacks, cryptography, classical attacks for the product type, attack methods, etc. implemented
in the product or system type.
EXAMPLE 3 Experienced technician or engineer.
Multiple experts:

Different fields of expertise are required at an expert level for distinct steps of an attack.

G.2.2.3

EXAMPLE 4 Multiple highly experienced engineers who have expertise in different fields,
and which are required at an expert level for distinct steps of an attack.

Example customization of knowledge of the item or component

The knowledge of the item or component parameter is related to the amount of information the attacker
has acquired about the item or component, see Table G.3.
Table G.3 — Knowledge of the item or component

Public information:
Public information concerning the item or component (e.g. as gained from the Internet).

EXAMPLE 1 Information and documents published on the product homepage or on an internet
forum.

﻿

Table G.3 (continued)
Restricted information:
Restricted information concerning the item or component (e.g. knowledge that is controlled within
the developer organization and shared with other organizations under a non-disclosure agreement).

EXAMPLE 2 Internal documentation shared between manufacturer and supplier, requirements and
design speciﬁcations.
Confidential information:

Confidential information about the item or component (e.g. knowledge that is shared between discrete teams within the developer organization, access to which is constrained only to members of
the specified teams).
EXAMPLE 3 Immobilizer-related information, software source code.
Strictly confidential information:

Strictly confidential information about the item or component (e.g. knowledge that is known by
only a few individuals, access to which is very tightly controlled on a strict need to know basis and
individual undertaking).
EXAMPLE 4 Customer specific calibrations or memory maps documented internally by the manufacturer and/or supplier.

G.2.2.4

Example customization of window of opportunity

The window of opportunity parameter is related to the access conditions (time, type) to successfully
perform an attack. It combines access type (e.g. logical and physical) and access duration (e.g. unlimited
and limited). Depending on the type of attack this might include discovery of possible targets, access
to a target, exploit works on the target, time to perform attack on a target, remaining undiscovered,
circumventing detections and cybersecurity controls, etc. (see Table G.4).
Table G.4 — Window of opportunity

Unlimited:
High availability via public/untrusted network without any time limitation (i.e. asset is always accessible). Remote access without physical presence or time limitation as well as unlimited physical
access to the item or component.

EXAMPLE 1 Remote attack (e.g. vehicle-to-anything or cellular interfaces) without any preconditions,
unlimited physical access by the owner for chip tuning.
Easy:

High availability and limited access time. Remote access without physical presence to the item or
component.

EXAMPLE 2 Pairing time of Bluetooth, remote software update, remote attack that requires the
vehicle standing still.
Moderate:

Low availability of the item or component. Limited physical and/or logical access. Physical access to
the vehicle interior or exterior without using any special tools.

EXAMPLE 3 Attacker enters an unlocked car and got access to exposed physical interface, e.g. physical access via on-board diagnostic port.
Difficult:

Very low availability of the item or component. Impractical level of access to the item or component
to perform the attack.
EXAMPLE 4 Decapping an IC to extract information, cracking a cryptographic key by brute force
faster than the key is rotated.

Single user licence only, copying and networking prohibited.

Example customization of equipment

The equipment parameter is related to the tools the attacker has available to discover the vulnerability
and/or to execute the attack, see Table G.5.
Table G.5 — Equipment

Standard:
Equipment is readily available to the attacker. This equipment can be a part of the product itself
(e.g. a debugger in an operating system), or can be readily obtained (e.g. internet sources, protocol
analyser or simple attack scripts).

EXAMPLE 1 Laptop, CAN adapter, on-board diagnostic dongle, ordinary tools (screwdriver, soldering
iron, pliers).
Specialized:

Equipment is not readily available to the attacker but can be acquired without undue effort. This
can include purchase of moderate amounts of equipment (e.g. power analysis tools, use of hundreds
of PCs linked across the internet would fall into this category), or development of more extensive
attack scripts or programs. If clearly different test benches consisting of specialized equipment are
required for distinct steps of an attack this would be rated as bespoke.

EXAMPLE 2 Specialized hardware debugging device, in-vehicle communication devices (hardware
in the loop test rig, high-grade oscilloscope, signal generator), special chemicals.
Bespoke:

Equipment is specially produced (e.g. very sophisticated software) and not readily available to the
public (e.g. black market), or the equipment is so specialized that its distribution is controlled, possibly even restricted. Alternatively, the equipment is very expensive.
EXAMPLE 3 Manufacturer-restricted tools, electron microscope.
Multiple bespoke:

Is introduced to allow for a situation, where different types of bespoke equipment are required for
distinct steps of an attack.

G.2.2.6

Example mapping between attack potential and attack feasibility

For each parameter, numerical values can be defined. Based on the ISO/IEC 18045
scales are proposed based on the adaptation presented above, see Table G.6.

G.3 Guidelines for the CVSS-based approach

≥ 25

To rate information technology security vulnerabilities, the CVSS maintained by the forum of incident
response and security teams (FIRST) [24] can be used. Within the base metrics group, the exploitability
metrics (cf. Reference [24], 7.1) can be used to rate attack feasibility. Other CVSS metrics (e.g. impact
metrics) are covered by aspects of this document, e.g. damage scenarios and impact assessment.
The exploitability metrics are:
— attack vector;

— attack complexity;

— privileges required; and
— user interaction.

They are described by FIRST [24]. Evaluation of the CVSS metrics yields numerical values for each metric
according within a pre-defined range. The overall exploitability value can be calculated on the basis of
a simple formula:
E = 8,22 × V × C × P × U

where
E

V
C
P
U

is the exploitability value;

is the numerical value associated to the attack vector, ranging from 0,2 to 0,85;

is the numerical value associated with the attack complexity, ranging from 0,44 to 0,77;

is the numerical value associated with the privileges required, ranging from 0,27 to 0,85; and
is the numerical value associated with user interaction, ranging from 0,62 to 0,85.

Consequently, the exploitability values range between 0,12 and 3,89.

An example mapping of CVSS exploitability values to attack feasibility, is given in Table G.8. This is an
example of equidistant exploitability steps.

NOTE
The procedure of using only the exploitability metrics as part of the bigger CVSS base metric group
does not strictly conform to the CVSS requirements for metrics. To calculate the risk in accordance with this
document, the missing impact metric can be compensated by the impact metrics of this document, see Annex F
and Reference [24].

Without changing the exploitability metric values, their descriptions can be supplemented to
give a better guidance with regard to the organization’s business and items or components under
development, and to reduce the potential for misinterpretations when applying the description to
actual vulnerabilities. Such supplements can be organization-specific examples which are added to the
metric value descriptions.
Apart from vulnerabilities, the CVSS exploitability metric can also be used to rate conceptual
weaknesses, flaws, and gaps.

G.4 Guidelines for the attack vector-based approach

The attack vector-based approach reflects the context by which attack path exploitation is possible.
Attack feasibility rating will be higher the more remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be
in order to exploit the attack path. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers that can
exploit a vulnerability using the internet is larger than the number of potential attackers that can
exploit an attack path requiring physical access to the item or component, see Table G.9.
Table G.9 — Attack vector-based approach

Attack feasibility rating
High

Criteria
Network:
Potential attack path is bound to network stack without any limitation.

Medium

Low

Very low

EXAMPLE 1 Cellular network connection making the ECU directly connected and accessible on the internet.
Adjacent:

Potential attack path is bound to network stack; however, the connection
is limited physically or logically.
EXAMPLE 2 Bluetooth interface, virtual private network connection.
Local:

Potential attack path is not bound to network stack and threat agents
require direct access to the item for realizing the attack path.
EXAMPLE 3 Universal serial bus mass storage device, memory card.
Physical:

Threat agents require physical access to realize the attack path.

Annex H
(informative)

Examples of application of TARA methods – headlamp system

H.1 General
The example of a headlamp system development and the respective work products in this annex are
provided for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to imply any particular approach for
practical use.
This annex can aid understanding of the requirements of this document by presenting examples of
applications of Threat Analysis and Risk Assessment (TARA) methods. This example only presents the
concept phase for illustrating TARA application and is presented in an abstracted, simplified manner. In
particular it addresses:
— item definition; and
— TARA.

TARA is defined as modular methods for analysis and each module can be proceeded in any order, for
example:

— identification of assets → identification of corresponding damage scenarios → impact rating →
threat scenarios identification → attack path analysis → …
— selection of damage scenarios from catalogues → impact rating → threat scenario identification →
identification of assets → …
The examples in this annex follow the order below:
i.

ii.

asset identification;
impact rating;

iii. threat scenario identification;
iv. attack path analysis;
v.

attack feasibility rating;

vi. risk value determination;
vii. risk treatment decision.

In step v, two different approaches are applied for rating the attack feasibility. One approach uses attack
vector-based approach (see [RC-15-14]) and the other approach uses attack potential-based approach
(see [RC-15-12]).
Figure H.1 provides an overview of various interactions between Clause 9 and 15.

NOTE 2
Each organization can apply rationales to each of the ratings based on their own policy. For example,
the window of opportunity is assigned 4 (moderate, refer to Table G.4) for the second attack path, because
physical access is required. The attack feasibility rating is determined considering all feasibility values based on
Table G.7.

H.2.7 Risk value determination

[RQ-09-03] also calls risk determination for each threat scenario in accordance with 15.8. Risk values
can be determined utilizing risk matrices defined by the organization for mapping combinations of
ratings of impact (see 15.5) and attack feasibility (see 15.7) to risk values. Table H.8 shows an example
risk matrix and Table H.9 shows example results of risk determination using Table H.8.

Risk values may also be determined by a risk formula defined by the organization. An example is shown
in the below formula and Table H.10.
R =1+ I ×F

For the specific threat scenarios displayed in Table H.9 the calculation using the example given in
Table H.8 and the above formula would lead to the same risk values.

H.2.8 Risk treatment decision

[RQ-09-04] requires selecting treatment options in accordance with 15.9. Table H.11 shows example
results of risk treatment decision.
